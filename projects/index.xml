      <description>What is CFF? CFF consists in a system fetch written for GNU/Linux system. It uses the Kernel api to fetch info such as the uptime and the kernel release name.
Why CFF? CFF is essencially a project developed for fun. However, it is the fastest fetching program due to being written in C. Compared to pfetch or even neofetch we get much lower execution times. Usually around 2 milliseconds.</description>

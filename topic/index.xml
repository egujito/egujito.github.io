      <description>Why I Changed from DWM to Qtile. Both managers are configured in the language they are built in that is why I love both so much. (DWM - C; Qtile - Python)
Pros of DWM Great default - DWM is great out of the box and if you want something simple you just create somekind of script to update xsetroot -name and you are good to go; Patches - Many patches have been released that extend the power of dwm; Fast; Solid Documentation - Documentation is great; Cons of DWM Patching - Patching comes as a pretty difficult task.</description>
